```

In both the full and the restricted model, none of the coefficients are significant. The focal relationship, the association between living sitution and contraception use is not significantly different in comparison to the reference category living "on-campus."

sex_net <- multinom(resp_contr_n ~ I(living_situation == "Greek") + 
                      # Manually specify argument.

           "None at all" = summary(sex_net)$coefficients[2,],
           "Z-Value" = z[2,],
           "P-value" = p[2,]) %>% knitr:: kable(caption = "Table 2: Multinomial Regression Results", digits = 3)
# NaN seem to be introduced because therre is separation in the data for one of them predictors. 
# Additionally, the numbers of non-binary individuals are so low that it is probably unlikely to get a response that is valid.

In this multinomial logit model, the reference category is "On-campus".
In comparison to living on-campus: 
* Being in the category greek corresponds to a `r summary(sex_net)$coefficients[1,2]` decrease in the log odds of using two methods of contraception compared to one method, but it is not statistically significant. 
* Being in the category off-campus corresponds to a `r summary(sex_net)$coefficients[1,3]` decrease in the log-odds of using two methods of protection in comparison to using one method, but this is not statistically significant either. 

In comparison to those living on campus: 
* Being in the category greek corresponds to a `r summary(sex_net)$coefficients[2,2]` decrease in the log-odds of using no protection at all in comparison to one method, but this is not significant. 
* Being in the ctegory Off-campus, corresponds to an `r summary(sex_net)$coefficients[2,3]` decrease in the log-odds of using no protection at all in comparison to 1 method of protection, but this is not significant.
